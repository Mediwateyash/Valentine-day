    <div class="note">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Hello Crush, Happy Valentine’s Day! 💖,
        <p>Whenever I see you, my heart does a little happy dance, and my smile refuses to leave my face. You’re like my favorite song on repeat, my personal sunshine on a cloudy day, and the reason my heart races faster than a WiFi signal in a coffee shop! ☕📶✨</p>

           <p> Every moment with you feels like a scene straight out of a romantic movie—except, in this one, I’m the hopeless romantic staring at you like you're the most beautiful thing in the universe (because you are). 🌹💫</p>
            
           <p> So, here’s to you—the reason behind my endless daydreams and my silliest grins. Hope this little surprise makes you smile as much as you make me! 😘💕</p>
           <!-- bold the text  -->
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">And well… if my heart had a language, it would be whispering your name on repeat. 💞✨
